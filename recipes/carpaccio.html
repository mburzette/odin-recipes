        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carpaccio is an Italian version of steak tartare. It is made of raw beef and dressed with lemony mayonnaise and was created in 
            Harry's Bar in Venice, which, despite the name, is actually a first-class restaurant opened by an Italian named Giuseppe Cipriani 
            in 1931. This version uses a balsamic vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise and is a wonderfully light summer meal.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Sea salt, to taste, divided</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound steak (tenderloin is best)</li>
            <li>1 cup baby arugula leaves</li>
            <l1>1 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or other hard Italian cheese</l1>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice the steak as thin as possible. This is much easier if it's partially frozen or you use an electric knife.</li>
            <li>Arrange the arugula on 2 plates, top with beef slices, and lightly season with good sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
            <li>Garnish with shavings of Parmigiano, then sprinkle lightly with the vinaigrette.</li>

        </ol>
